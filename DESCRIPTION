Description: The half-weight index gregariousness (HWIG) is an association 
             index used in social network analyses. It extends the half-weight 
             association index (HWI), correcting for level of gregariousness 
             in individuals. It is calculated using group by individual 
             data according to methods described in Godde et al. (2013) 
             <doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.010>.
